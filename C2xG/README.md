# Tagging Sentences with Constructions

To tag sentences with constructions we make use of the package c2xg 1.0 with some minor modifications. 

**If you are interested in sentences already tagged with construtional information, see the [Tagged Sentences](https://github.com/H-TayyarMadabushi/CxGBERT-BERT-meets-Construction-Grammar/blob/master/C2xG/README.md#tagged-sentences) section below**

For details on how the constructions are identified and tagged, see *[Computational learning of construction grammars](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/language-and-cognition/article/computational-learning-of-construction-grammars/43E9BA63CD01CB2912029FF32721076E)*  and the associated program code [c2xg 1.0](https://github.com/jonathandunn/c2xg)

# Tagged Sentences

The WikiText language modeling dataset is a collection of over 100 million tokens extracted from the set of verified Good and Featured articles on Wikipedia. (See [Here](https://www.salesforce.com/products/einstein/ai-research/the-wikitext-dependency-language-modeling-dataset/) for original release) 

**We release the raw WikiText 103 data with associated constructional information tagged.**

 - You can find files containing 1 sentence per line in [THIS](https://github.com/H-TayyarMadabushi/CxGBERT-BERT-meets-Construction-Grammar/tree/master/C2xG/data/sentences) folder  
 - The pickle (Python 3) files in [THIS](https://github.com/H-TayyarMadabushi/CxGBERT-BERT-meets-Construction-Grammar/tree/master/C2xG/data/cxg) folder contains a List where the
   element in the ith index contains a (second) list of all
   constructions that sentence i from the corresponding file is an
   instance of.


## Data Examples

	  
Here are the first 5 lines of the file sentences00
	
	<BLANK LINE>
	= Valkyria Chronicles III =
	Senjō no Valkyria 3 : Unrecorded Chronicles ( Japanese : 戦場のヴァ	ルキュリア3 , lit .
	Valkyria of the Battlefield 3 ) , commonly referred to as Valkyria Chronicles III outside Japan , is a tactical role @-@ playing video game developed by Sega and Media.Vision for the PlayStation Portable .
	Released in January 2011 in Japan , it is the third game in the Valkyria series .

Here are the first 5 elements of the array stored in sents-cxg-tagged-0.pk

	[]
	[]
	[]
	[6076, 7976, 15090, 21689, 16, 647, 21305]
	[21913, 7192, 7479, 13952, 14327, 14638, 8559, 16, 647, 21305]

This means that the first three lines (an empty line, the title and the line with Japanese text in it) are instances of no constructions and that line 4 (*Valkyria of the Battlefield 3 ) ...*) is an instance of the constructions numbered *[6076, 7976, 15090, 21689, 16, 647, 21305]*

Note that what these constructions are is not available. 

## Tagging Sentences

Tagging sentences is done using the C2xG with the changes listed in [THIS](https://github.com/H-TayyarMadabushi/CxGBERT-BERT-meets-Construction-Grammar/tree/master/C2xG/c2xg-update) folder. These changes will soon be merged with the original package. These changes do NOT in any way change the actual constructions, they are used only to greatly speed up tagging. 

[wikiTextParser.py](https://github.com/H-TayyarMadabushi/CxGBERT-BERT-meets-Construction-Grammar/blob/master/C2xG/wikiTextParser.py) is first be used to clean WikiText-103 and generate a list of sentences. The output of this is equivalent to a single file with all files in the [sentences folder](https://github.com/H-TayyarMadabushi/CxGBERT-BERT-meets-Construction-Grammar/tree/master/C2xG/data/sentences) are concatenated.

[tagger.py](https://github.com/H-TayyarMadabushi/CxGBERT-BERT-meets-Construction-Grammar/blob/master/C2xG/tagger.py) can be used to tag sentences in 100,000 shards. It needs to be run multiple times.
